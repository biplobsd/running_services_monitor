Running Services Monitor helps you monitor running services on your Android device. With a clean and intuitive interface, you can easily view system and user apps and check their status efficiently.

<b>Features</b>

* Monitor Running Services: View a comprehensive list of all running services on your device
* Categorized View: Easily switch between All, User, and System apps
* Search Functionality: Quickly find specific apps with the built-in search bar
* App Details: Get detailed information about each app, including package name, version, and more
* Root & Shizuku Integration: First checks for root permission, then falls back to Shizuku for advanced system interactions (where supported)
* Material Design 3: A modern and beautiful UI that adapts to your device's theme
* Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes for comfortable viewing
* Localization: Support for English, Bangla, Chinese languages

<b>Requirements</b>

Essential:

* Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
* Root access (preferred) OR Shizuku app installed and running

Permissions:

* QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES - To list all installed apps
* Root permission OR Shizuku permission - The app first checks for root access, then falls back to Shizuku if root is unavailable

<b>How It Works</b>

This app uses root access or Shizuku to execute privileged ADB commands. Starting from Android 8.0 (API 26), the `ActivityManager.getRunningServices()` API was deprecated and restricted. Third-party apps can no longer query all running services on the device for privacy and security reasons.

Root access provides the most seamless experience with direct access to system commands and no additional setup required.

Shizuku provides an alternative for non-rooted devices by running a privileged service that can access system APIs, allowing apps to execute ADB commands without root, working on non-rooted devices via Wireless Debugging (Android 11+) or USB ADB.

The app checks for root permission first, and if not available, falls back to Shizuku. It executes `dumpsys activity services` to get running service information, parses the output to extract service details (package name, PID, process name, etc.), and categorizes services into System and User categories.

<b>Limitations</b>

* Due to Android security policies, some service information may be limited
* When using Shizuku, the service stops when device reboots
* Dumpsys output format may vary across Android versions
* This app only displays services; it cannot start/stop them

This app is designed for users who want to monitor running services on their device, similar to the "Running Services" feature that was available in Android Developer Options in older Android versions.
